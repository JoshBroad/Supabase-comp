I will create a comprehensive backend implementation guide based on the detailed specifications found in `backend.md` and the architectural principles in `supabse.md`.

### Plan
1.  **Analyze & Extract**: I have analyzed `backend.md` and `supabse.md`. I will synthesize the following components into a unified technical specification:
    *   **Architecture**: The distinction between the **Control Plane** (orchestrator) and the **Provisioned Environment** (the user's generated app).
    *   **Database Schema**: Detailed definitions for `build_sessions`, `build_events`, `spec_chunks`, and `drift_alerts`.
    *   **API Specification**: Endpoints for session management (`POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/:id`) and event retrieval.
    *   **Realtime Contract**: The `build:{sessionId}` channel structure, presence payloads, and event schemas.
    *   **Orchestration Logic**: The LangGraph node sequence (Ingest -> Plan -> Provision -> Migrate -> RLS -> Deploy -> Analytics).
    *   **Security & RLS**: Baseline policies and security requirements for both the control plane and provisioned resources.
    *   **MCP Integration**: Specific guidelines for using Supabase MCP for safe provisioning.

2.  **Generate Guide**: I will write a new file named `backend-implementation-guide.md` containing this structured specification. This file will serve as the single source of truth for the backend build.

3.  **Review**: I will verify that the generated guide covers all requirements mentioned in the user's prompt (database setup, RLS, serverless functions, auth, API integration) and follows Supabase best practices.
